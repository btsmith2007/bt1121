<h1 style="text-align:center;">Welcome to the JetBlue Dashboard</h1>
<p>In the event the Manila Global Service Desk (GSD) experiences an incident that requires the activation of their Business Continuity Plan, the Phoenix Contact Center (PCC) will be notified, and the Disaster Recovery (DR) Plan will be implemented.  When the Disaster Recovery Plan is enacted, the Phoenix Contact Center will assume the GSD customer support responsibilities, and ensure all customers continue to receive support.</p>
<p>During DR implementation, PCC will prioritize all support requests as follows:</p>
  
<ul>
<li>Priority 1 and 2 tickets</li> 
<li>Change Requests</li>
<li>Priority 3 and lower tickets</li>
<li>Maintenance Window Requests</li>
<li>Escort Requests</li>
</ul>

<p>All issues will be reviewed and handled based on their criticality with the most important issues handled first.</p>  

<p>This manual will guide the user through the process of working through the job responsibilities currently done by the GSD.  Keep in mind that the focus of support should be for all Priority 1 and 2 tickets.  As time and personnel are available, working Change Request, lower priority tickets, etc. will take place, but are not the focus in a DR situation.</p>

<p>When the Manila Global Service Desk activates their Continuity Plan, notification that DR is activated will be sent to PMO, Tier 1 Helpdesk (ITSD) ENOC, SOC, and the MIM.  An informational conference bridge will be established to provide an update on the status of the GSD.</p>
